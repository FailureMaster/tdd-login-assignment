# tdd-login-assignment

Write the test cases for the login application. This is a working login and the test cases are provided, just make sure to fill in the necessary test code for the test cases to **pass**.

If you run this app on your browser, and test the features, you will notice that it will just respond with a json object. This is intentional. The full working version of this app will include AJAX functionality that requires a different approach for testing (You will learn how to test AJAX requests later).

Run **npm test** command in a separate shell to see all your test output.

# Instructions

1. You will need to run the node server first before running any tests. 
2. Make sure you work on this assignment in a docker container. The necessarily files to build and run this app in a docker container is already provided.
3. An email 'jrosales@village88.com' with password 'password' is provided in the users table of the hh database.
4. Once done, you need to zip your app in one file and upload the zipped file in Hacker Hero.
